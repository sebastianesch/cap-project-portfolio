# Troubleshooting Tips

## Connectivity Issues

When your apps in the launchpad show erors instead of number for customes or projects or you can't load data in the apps
you need to check the root cause of the issue.

You can check connectivity issues in the Network tab of the Developer Tools in your browser. To see only the requests
to your CAP application, you have to filter the requests, otherwise you will see a lot of requests for UI5 resources,
that are not relevant for connectivity issues with your CAP backend.

In the examples we use OData V4 for the apps, so the backend URLs all start with `/odata/v4/...`, so filtering on `v4` shows
only requests to the backend.

Things to check:
 - Is your CAP App running? Check in the Applications section of your Cloud Foundry space. (404 Not Found Error)
 - Is your HANA Cloud Instance started? Check in the HANA Cloud section of your Cloud Foundry space. (500 Internal Server Error)
 - Is your Role Collection setup correctly? Check in the Role Collections section of your Subaccount. (403 Forbidden Error)
